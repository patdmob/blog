Life has it's ups and downs. But I've always liked to learn. It's fun to discover the world and how it works. It's always **enjoyable** to *Netflix and chill* but so much more **satifying** to *Make* something. Part of my life is maintaining a balance between these two.  

I took a two-year hiatus from writing posts. But I've found my spark again so you should see much more to come. Topics might be all over the place; I took this space too serously last time. So now I'll write whatever takes my fancy: perhaps topics like electronics, Raspberry Pi, data science, or economics. 

I program in mostly Python these days but I'm not committing to anything. You'll see older posts in R. And as I learn and work more with microprocessors and microcontrollers you might see something else.

Thanks and I hope you enjoy.
